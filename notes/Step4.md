# STEP4: Database

## 1. Write into a database

* What are the advantages of saving into a database such as SQLite instead of saving into a single JSON file?

> Efficient data management and querying capabilities. Database systems support complex query languages that enable more efficient management of large amounts of data.

> Data Consistency and Integrity Guarantee. Databases maintain data consistency and integrity by means of constraints, transaction processing, and rollback mechanisms.

> Concurrent Access and Security. Databases are designed to efficiently handle multi-user or multi-process concurrent access, including locking mechanisms.

## 3. Move the category information to a separate table

* What is database **normalization**?

> Database normalization is a design methodology, breaking down a large table into multiple smaller interrelated tables, aiming to organize data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
