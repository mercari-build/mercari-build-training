# STEP5: Run the application in a virtual environment

## 3. Get Docker Image

* Make sure you understand the following commands and when to use them.

A: Here areSome common Docker comands.
Get the currently installed version of docker:
```shell
$ docker â€“version
```
Pull images from the docker repository:
```shell
$ docker pull <image_name>
```
Create a container from an image:
```shell
$ docker run -it -d <image_name>
```
List all the locally stored docker images:
```shell
$ docker images
```
Delete unnecessary images: (very useful)
```shell
$ docker rmi -f <image_id>
```

## 5. Modify Dockerfile

After modifying the dockerfile, run
```shell
$ docker build -t build2024/app:latest -f python/Dockerfile .
``` 
(don't forget the dot)
to create the image, and run
```shell
$ docker run build2024/app:latest
```
and the output would be
```shell
Python 3.9.18
```

## 6. Run the listing API on Docker

* Here's the memo of the first git:
I got a problem here.
`python/main.py` works well on the local host.
However, after I run
```shell
$ docker run build2024/app:latest
```
When the api is initializing with the function `start_connection`,
there's some error in row 76 "unable to open database file".
I think that the path may be wrong. But I have no idea how to check the file structure in the docker.

* Solution

To check the file structure in the block by
```shell
$ dive <image_id or image_name>
```

For example, after creating the image `build2024/app:latest`, roll to the Filetree app and check it.

What's more, after executing `CMD` in `dockerfile`, the path is where `python.py` is. Thus, the original path code
```python
path = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.resolve()
```
is changed into
```python
path = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.parent.resolve()
```
