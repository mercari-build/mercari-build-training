# STEP2: Building local environment

Choose either Python or Go and build your local environment.

## Building Python environment

### 1. Install Python
* If your local version is below Python3.9, install Python3.13.
* If you have Python3.9 or above, you can skip the installation step.

### 2. Check your Python version

* Check if the Python is added to your PATH (usable as commands on your terminal) with the following command.

```shell
$ python3 -V
# Or $ python -V
```

If the version does not correspond to the Python version you installed, double check your installation as it is not **added to your PATH**.

### 3. Install dependencies

The list of dependent libraries is written in a file called `requirements.txt` in a typical Python project.
You can install the dependencies by running the following command.

```shell
$ cd python

# Create virtual environment for this application
$ python3 -m venv .venv　

# Activate virtual environment
$ source .venv/bin/activate # for Mac or Unix user
$ .venv/Scripts/activate # for Windows user

# Install required library
$ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you added a library, make sure you add it to `requirements.txt`.

`python3 -m venv .venv` is a command to create a Python virtual environment.
A virtual environment is a way to create a project-specific Python environment.
Using a virtual environment allows you to manage necessary packages separately for each project so that you can avoid dependency conflicts between different projects.
Once the virtual environment is created, it must be activated by the `source .venv/bin/activate` command.

* [venv — Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
* [Install packages in a virtual environment using pip and venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

### 4. Run the Python app

```shell
$ uvicorn main:app --reload --port 9000
```

If successful, you can access the local host `http://127.0.0.1:9000` on our browser and you will see`{"message": "Hello, world!"}`.

## Building Go environment
### 1. Install Go
* If your local version is below Go1.24, install Go1.24.
* If you have Go1.24 or above, you can skip the installation step.

Download it from [this link](https://go.dev/dl/)!  
※ If you are using a Mac and are unsure whether to download the `x86-64` or `ARM64` version, click on the Apple logo at the top left corner > select "About This Mac". If the chip is listed as "Apple" choose `ARM64`; if it's "Intel" select `x86-64`.

### 2. Check your Go version

* Check if Go is added to your PATH (usable as commands on your terminal) with the following command.


```shell
$ go version
```

If the version does not correspond to the Python version you installed, double check your installation as it is not **added to your PATH**.

* [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/)
* [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)](https://mercari.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-developers-guide/)
  * Section11 is closely related to the content of this training and is particularly recommended as a reference.

### 3. Install dependencies

In Go, dependent libraries are managed in a file called `go.mod`.
You can install the dependencies by running the following command.

```shell
$ cd go
$ go mod tidy
```

**:beginner: Point**

Understand the role of `go.mod` and the commands around it referring to this [document](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-The_go_mod_file).

### 4. Run the Go app

```shell
$ go run cmd/api/main.go
```

If successful, you can access the local host `http://127.0.0.1:9000` on our browser and you will see`{"message": "Hello, world!"}`.
To stop the server, press Ctrl+C.

**:beginner: Points**

* If you're using Linux or Mac, understand when and how `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc` are activated and used (or `.zshrc` if you're using zsh).
* Understand what it means to **add to PATH**.
