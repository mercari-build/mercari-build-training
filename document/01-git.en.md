## Install Git
1. Install git in your environment and run the following command.

   <your-email-address>
   ```

## Use basic commands in Git

1. **Clone** `https://github.com/<your github id>/mercari-build-training` onto your local using the following command.
   ```shell
   $ cd <your working space>
   $ git clone https://github.com/<your github id>/mercari-build-training
   ```

**:bangbang: Caution**

Please definitely run the following command after cloning repository. 
```
cd mercari-build-training
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/ 
```
This is required to use githooks in mercari-build-training repository.

2. Make a new branch named `first-pull-request` and **switch** into this branch
   ```shell
   $ cd <your working space>/mercari-build-training
   $ git branch first-pull-request
   $ git switch first-pull-request
   ```
3. Replace `@<your github id>` on README.md with your GitHub ID.
4. **commit** the changes you made with the following commands.
   ```shell
   $ git status # Check your change
   $ git add README.md # Add README.md file to the list of files to commit
   $ git commit -m "Update github id" # Brief description about the changes
   ```
5. **push** changes to GitHub.
   ```shell
   $ git push origin first-pull-request:first-pull-request
   ```
6. Open `https://github.com/<your github id>/mercari-build-training` and make a **Pull Request** (PR).
    - base branch: `main`
    - target branch: `first-pull-request`

## Review a PR and have your PR reviewed
- Once you made a PR, ask a teammate for review.
- If at least one person `approve`s the PR, `merge` into the main branch
- Open your teammates' PRs and check the files changed, and `approve` if you think the changes look good.
