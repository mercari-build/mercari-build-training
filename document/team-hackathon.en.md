# Team hackathon

Form a team and propose and develop a new listing feature at Mercari.

For example,

* A better and more user-friendly UI
* Allow videos for listing
* Use OCR for automatically input the item title
* Speech-to-text input

Any types of improvement on the listing feature are welcome in different aspects like UI, Backend or AI.


## Development Process

* Choose one person to create a repository on GitHub
  * Make the repository public and add everyone in your Hackathon team as contributors
* Each team member should contribute via Pull Requests and work from their own branch

**:beginner: Point**

* Brainstorm what would be necessary for the User Experience (UX) by using the current Mercari App (iOS, Android, Web)
